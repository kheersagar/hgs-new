    The School is a stepping stone, responsible for the overall development of a naive and innocent child into a responsible, sensible, and law-abiding citizen. It is a home away from home for all its students and for me too, HGS was my extended family for five years. The school was responsible for shaping my character and personality. At HGS, I and most of my peers have always felt that teachers were our friends, philosophers, and guides. They cared about every student & always tried to give the best advice.

    I earned a B.Sc. (Hons) in Agriculture from CCS HAU, Hisar where I was the batch topper (2005-09). I completed my Masters degree from IIM Ahmedabad, where I specialized in agribusiness during the PGDM- ABM (2009-11). The reason why I had chosen SOS HGS over other schools in Faridabad was due to the ethos which the school had and still continues to have. The open culture and sense of collaboration among students and faculty, complete sense of freedom for a child's overall growth and the need to be rooted to one's core values were probably the greatest takeaways for me from the school.
